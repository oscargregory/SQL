<h1>Apply Filters to SQL Queries</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. You recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.

Your task is to examine the organization’s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. You’ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.

Note: This scenario involves the same queries as the ones the 
"Filter with AND, OR, and NOT" lab. You can revisit the lab to get screenshots to include in your portfolio. If you choose, it's also possible to complete this activity without revisiting the lab by typing your queries in the template.
